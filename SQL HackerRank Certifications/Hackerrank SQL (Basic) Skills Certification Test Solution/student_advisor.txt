DESCRIPTION:
This is a SQL query that retrieves the roll number and name of students who are advised by faculty members that meet certain criteria.

The WHERE clause specifies two conditions that must be met for a faculty member to be included in the results: their gender must be 'M' and their salary must be greater than 15000, or their gender must be 'F' and their salary must be greater than 20000.

The SELECT clause retrieves the roll number and name of students from the "student_information" table.

Overall, this query returns a list of students who are advised by faculty members who meet the specified criteria.

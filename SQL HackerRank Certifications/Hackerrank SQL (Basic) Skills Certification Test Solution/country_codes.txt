DESCRIPTION:
This is a SQL query that retrieves customer phone numbers, along with their customer ID and name, with the country code prepended to the phone number. 

The query selects the customer ID and name from the "customers" table, and concatenates the country code from the "country_codes" table with the phone number from the "customers" table using the CONCAT function. The country code is preceded by a "+" character to conform to the international phone number format.

The LEFT JOIN clause joins the "customers" table with the "country_codes" table based on the "country" column in both tables.

The ORDER BY clause orders the results in ascending order by customer ID.

Overall, this query returns a list of customer phone numbers with their country codes, along with their customer ID and name, sorted by customer ID. If a customer's country is not found in the "country_codes" table, the phone number will still be displayed, but without the country code.

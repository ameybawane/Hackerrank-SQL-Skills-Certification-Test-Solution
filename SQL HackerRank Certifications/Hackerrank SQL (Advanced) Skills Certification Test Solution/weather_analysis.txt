DESCRIPTION:
SQL query that retrieves monthly temperature statistics from the "temperature_records" table.

The query selects the month of the record date, and calculates the maximum, minimum, and average temperature for each month. The maximum temperature is retrieved for rows where the data_type is 'max', the minimum temperature for rows where the data_type is 'min', and the average temperature for rows where the data_type is 'avg'. The round function is used to round the average temperature to the nearest integer.

The WHERE clause filters the results to only include records with a record date in the months of July through December (inclusive).

The GROUP BY clause groups the results by month of the record date.

The ORDER BY clause orders the results in ascending order by month of the record date.

Overall, this query returns the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for each month of the second half of the year.

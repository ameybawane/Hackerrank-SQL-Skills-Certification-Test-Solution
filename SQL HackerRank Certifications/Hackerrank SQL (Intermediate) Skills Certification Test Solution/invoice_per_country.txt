DESCRIPTION:
This is a SQL query that retrieves the average invoice total and count of invoices, grouped by country, for countries where the average invoice total is greater than the overall average invoice total.

The query uses table aliases for each of the tables: "co" for "country", "ci" for "city", "cu" for "customer", and "i" for "invoice". 

The FROM clause specifies the tables that will be used in the query, and the WHERE clause specifies the join conditions between the tables: "co.id=ci.country_id" joins the "country" and "city" tables, "ci.id=cu.city_id" joins the "city" and "customer" tables, and "cu.id=i.customer_id" joins the "customer" and "invoice" tables.

The GROUP BY clause groups the results by country name.

The HAVING clause filters the results to only include countries where the average invoice total is greater than the overall average invoice total. The subquery "(select avg(total_price)from invoice)" retrieves the overall average invoice total.

The SELECT clause retrieves the country name, count of invoices, and average invoice total, and uses the AVG function to calculate the average invoice total.

Overall, this query returns a list of countries with their invoice count and average invoice total, but only for countries where the average invoice total is greater than the overall average invoice total.
